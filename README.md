BroadwaySimpleSerializer
------------------------

At SIMgroep we're really fond of DDD, CQRS and event sourcing. We build our applications using the Symfony
framework and Broadway. One of the things in Broadway that requires a lot of repetitions is implementing
the `Broadway\Serializer\Serializable` for your domain events. The serializer in this repository
aims to solve this problem. Yes, this is a little bit of magic. And magic is evil. Use it wisely!
